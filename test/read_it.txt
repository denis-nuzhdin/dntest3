You use JMeter and want to test an application that massively uses JSON data as exchange format.

JSON has become a de-facto standard nowadays and is used often:

To return data through Ajax Calls within dynamic websites
To return data through HTTP calls for Mobile Applications
As a REST webservice exchange format
As a storage format for NO-SQL databases like MongoDB
Of course you can still extract content with core JMeter using Regular Expression Extractor but this
becomes quite tedious, inefficient if not impossible when you have a lot of JSON elements with same attribute names.
